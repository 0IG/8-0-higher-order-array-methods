## Instructions

Complete each function inside of the `index.js` file. Use the comments and tests which describe what to do.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your repository.

```
npm test
```

This will run the test output once.

#### Test watcher

If you'd like, you can have the tests run constantly. This means that each time you save your file, your tests will re-run. To do so, you can run the following:
